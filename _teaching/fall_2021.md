## Overview 

System Dynamics was the course I assisted with during my first semester of graduate school. For this role, I graded assignments, held office hours, and instructed a lab section. All of the lab sections used MATLAB and/or Simulink in some capacity, as well as experimenting with breadboard circuity through oscilliscopes.

This course covered how to mathematically model mechanical and electrical systems using ordinary differential equations. This course also presented fundamentals of feedback systems to students, such as how to design and simulate a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) conteroller.
