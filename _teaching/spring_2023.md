## Overview 

Algorithms was the first course I assisted with in the Computer Science department at CU. This is due to the fact I began as a PhD student in CU's Department of Mechanical Engineering. Nonetheless, I had taken graduate-level algorithms at this point, so I felt ready to take it on despite it being an upper-level undergrad course.
