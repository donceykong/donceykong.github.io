During my second semester at CU, I took a graduate-level course in object-oriented design (OOD). The semester project was to use OOD patterns to make a large-scale project. Students chose from a pretty wide array of ideas, but due to my background in robotics and my teammates' background in linguistics, a chatbot proved to be a happy middleground.

For this project, we used a Raspberry Pi and equipped it with a reSpeaker 4-mic array. Keep in mind this was before LLM's took off or else we would have likely had a much better project to showcase.
