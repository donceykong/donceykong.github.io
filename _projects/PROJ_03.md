After my Junior year of undergrad, I joined Dr. Steven Simske's lab in the Systems Engineering Department at CSU. I was awarded an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), which supported me to do research during the Summer of 2020. One of the major interests of my advisor at that time, Dr. Steven Simske, was intelligent fire mitigation strategies. This was a year after my interests in robotics took off, so the task was the right fit. 

I used this opportunity to refine my SolidWorks and mechatronics skills by designing and making a semi-autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that could detect, track, and attempt to eliminate any threats of fire.
