During my mechatronics course in undergrad, the students had to form teams to produce a project by the end of the semester. The team I joined decided that we wanted something much different than previous semester submissions and something that might win the hearts of the students: automated beer pong. We made the decision to name the project Beruit, since involving references to alcohol in a university project probably would not have sat right with the professor. 

After the project was submitted, I sent in a video of me using the system to [DesignNews](https://www.designnews.com/mechatronics/in-search-of-mechatronics-skills), but I never heard back. Maybe it was because I accidentally referenced "Design Magazine" in the video? Oops... Anyways, you can find the video I submitted below! Please ignore the rats nest of wires.
