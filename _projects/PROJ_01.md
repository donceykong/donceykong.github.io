This was the semester project for the Advanced Robotics graduate course at CU. There were two options for a final projects: 

1) Simulate a car autonomously navigating a track in the Webots simulator.

2) Use a real RC-styled robot to navigate the basement of the Engineering Center at CU.

The team I joined preferred to get our hands dirty with ROS and attempt the second of these options. Our goals were to get first get the robot set up, then get 2D SLAM working, then get a controller working so that it could successfully run labs around the basement of the Engineering Center.

The robot we decided to use was the Amazon DeepRacer RC Car platform. This allowed us to circumvent many of the troubles that could have presented themselves if we decided to build the robot from scratch and focus more on the algorithic methods we learned during the course.
