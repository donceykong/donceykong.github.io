Hey, my name is Doncey. I am a PhD canidate in the Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group (ARPG) at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by professor Christoffer Heckman.

My research has primarily focused on perception and navigation, and more recently, with an emphasis on multi-robot mapping and navigation. I'm passionate about real-world robotics, so I prioritize projects that are validated on physical systems, despite the frustrating bottlenecks that often arise when doing so.

Outside of my work as a PhD student, I also like to work projects at home when I can find the time. Some examples of these can be found on the projects page. Beyond my passion in robotics, I have major interests in art, skateboarding, and community. I will likely add a tab for these interests in due time. 

## Community

In 2017 I was selected to be the keynote speaker at the Denver Kids' Annual Breakfast Gala. Denver Kids has a mission to ensure every student in Denver graduates and the counselors that work there truly make it happen. This opportunity to be a keynote speaker was a huge privledge and undertaking. Denver Kids made an incredible impact in my and my siblings' lives, so giving back to them in such a high-level manner was an honor. However, public speaking was new to me and doing it front of such a large crowd was intimidating. It took months for me to prepare for this speech, which I am happy I did, because in the end it all worked out. If you want to watch the speech, it can be viewed below.
