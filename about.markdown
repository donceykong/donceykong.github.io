Hey, I am Doncey and thanks for visting my website. Here you will find various robotics/software projects I have worked on, my CV, and classes I have assisted with teaching at the University of Colorado - Boulder. My hope is that this website will offer an enhanced display of my professional interests and capability than what a traditional CV could offer - maybe even some of my personality, too.

I am a third-year PhD student in the Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group (ARPG) at the University of Colorado - Boulder. My work here has mostly been in perception and navigation. This includes using deep learning neural networks to semantically segment, complete, and bound objects in lidar point clouds and RGB-D images for improved envronmental understanding, using tools like GTSAM (LIO-SAM, FAST-LIO) for SLAM, and integrating these tools within the ROS/ROS2 frameworks for deployment. All of my work has been deployed on a real robot to work in near real-time conditions. I have done a few grad course projects that are related to robotics as well, which can be found in the 'course projects' section on the projects page.

Outside of my work as a PhD student, I also have worked on many projects at home out of pure interest. This includes designing and 3D printing a 5-axis robotic arm, some experimentation with OpenCV's C++ API, and other random things. These all can be found in the 'home projects' section on the projects page.

Other than my passion in robotics, I have major interests in art, skateboarding, and community. I will likely add a tab for these interests in due time. 

## Community

In 2017 I was selected to be the keynote speaker at the Denver Kids' Annual Breakfast Gala. Denver Kids has a mission to ensure every student in Denver graduates and the counselors that work there truly make it happen. This opportunity to be a keynote speaker was a huge privledge and undertaking. Denver Kids made an incredible impact in my and my siblings' lives, so giving back to them in such a high-level manner was an honor. However, public speaking was new to me and doing it front of such a large crowd was intimidating. It took months for me to prepare for this speech, which I am happy I did, because in the end it all worked out. If you want to watch the speech, it can be viewed below.
