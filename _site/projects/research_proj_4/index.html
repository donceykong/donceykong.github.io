    <p>My most recent research was funded by a grant from Lockheed Martin. The goal was to build off a former student’s work of enabling robots to collaborate during navigation missions in communication-constrained, GPS-denied indoor environments. While there have been many works posed at improving the task of multi-robot communication in some capacity, this student’s work had an interesting approach to reduce the dimentionality of mapped data:</p>

<p>1) While mapping indoors, transform each 3D pointcloud into 2D laserscan, if not already in 2D.</p>

<p>2) Classify major known areas (cooridoors) from 2D laserscan into semantic categories using machine learning.</p>

<p>3) As the 2D laserscan-based map is being built, replace sections of classified points with their corresponding shape that encompasses them.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is not a gross oversimplification of the work’s pipeline, but it is definitely the easiest for people to read. Three steps is simple, right?</p>

<p>Anyways, the end result of this approach allowed robots to communicate their individual maps using much more memory-efficient shape primitives that what point clouds can offer. This enabled robots to share indoor maps they made not only faster, but also in bandwidth-constrained environments (think subterranean). Further, the maps generally reduced to a shape resembling the laserscan-based map, but with even more uniqueness, since the sequence of shapes provided a key. The general geometric outline of these efficient indoor map representations, along with the uniqueness of the semantic shape sequence that it’s shape comprised of, meant that map-merging was not only achievable, but also very fast.</p>

<h3 id="my-task-was-to-take-the-work-into-outdoor-settings">My task was to take the work into outdoor settings.</h3>

<p>One of the major challenges here was that the original work used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify indoor areas (cooridoors). This worked well for the indoor scenes, which were mostly static and fully-observed. However, due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of outdoor scenes, it was decided that this approach would be best benefitted by utilizing deep-learning methods to semantically understand the environment.</p>
