This led to an internal position within their R&D surgical robotics group to lead the project further into funding for production. After demonstrating that the system we designed could work autonomously and would provide practitioners with better ability to treat patients, the project received continued funding. Eventually, after meeting multiple milestones, the project was the first graduate-level project in the history of Medtronic's surgical robotics R&D to go on to receive funding for production.",
